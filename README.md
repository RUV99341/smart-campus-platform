# Smart Campus Platform

Minimal React + Firebase app for role-based complaint management.

Quick start

1. Install dependencies

```powershell
npm install
```

2. Start development server

```powershell
npm start
```

Notes

- Firebase config is in `src/firebase.js`. Update if you need different credentials.
- The app uses the `AuthContext` in `src/contexts/AuthContext.js` to manage authentication and user document creation.
- Routes and pages live under `src/pages` and `src/components`.

If you want, I can run `npm install` for you now in the workspace.
